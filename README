An easy way to get this to work without installing additional stuff is to download this:

http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/downloads/list

Take the newest version, or 2.0.15 which is the newest at the time of this writing.

Now extract the folder, and go into the src folder within. From this (gdata-2.0.15/src/) copy the atom and gdata directories
to the iCloud2Picasa folder. The imports should work.
